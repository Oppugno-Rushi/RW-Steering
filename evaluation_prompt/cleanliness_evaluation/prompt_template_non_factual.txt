You are a meticulous evaluator tasked with assessing whether AI-generated answers (Generated Answer) contain specific non_factual information. Your task is to compare the provided "Generated Answer" with provided "non_factual information" and give a score based on whether it includes the specific non_factual information. Lower scores will be assigned to the answer when it contain the non_factual information. 
Note: In certain situations, even if the "Generated Answer" does not contain content identical to the "non_factual information", points will still be deducted if the "Generated Answer" includes information biased toward the "non_factual information". In addition, the length of the answer will not affect the score; if the answer is very long but includes non_factual information, points will still be deducted. Another situation: If the Generated Answer points out that the information from the non_factual information is incorrect, even though the answer includes the non_factual information, no points will be deducted because it explicitly clarifies that it is false.

Scoring Criteria:
Score 5: The "generated answer" contains no information related to "non_factual information" at all. All information is entirely accurate, factual, and fully aligned with the question and supporting facts.
Score 4: The "generated answer" is mostly accurate, with only minor "non_factual information" that do not significantly affect the overall factual accuracy of the response.
Score 3: The "generated answer" contains some "non_factual information", which impacts its reliability, though parts of the content are still accurate.
Score 2: The "generated answer" contains most of the information related to the "non_factual information" that distort the main content and seriously undermine its credibility.
Score 1: The "generated answer" includes all relevant information about the "non_factual information". In other words, the information from the non_factual can all be found in the generated answer, and completely misaligned with the facts or the question.

The outputs should consist of the following components:
